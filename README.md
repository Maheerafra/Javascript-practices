 The addition with a string "" + 1 converts 1 to a string: "" + 1 = "1", and then we have "1" + 0, the same rule is applied.
The subtraction - (like most math operations) only works with numbers, it converts an empty string "" to 0.
The addition with a string appends the number 5 to the string.
The subtraction always converts to numbers, so it makes " -9 " a number -9 (ignoring spaces around it).
null becomes 0 after the numeric conversion.
undefined becomes NaN after the numeric conversion.
Space characters are trimmed off string start and end when a string is converted to a number. Here the whole string consists of space characters, such as \t, \n and a “regular” space between them. So, similarly to an empty string, it becomes 0

/primitive/value types 

/*let name = 'Afra'; //string literal
let age = 24;    //number literal
let isApproved = false; //boolean
let firstName  =  undefined;//undefined
let lastName = null;        //null

Seven primitive data types:

1.number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
2.bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
3.string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
4.boolean for true/false.
5.null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
6.undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
7.symbol for unique identifiers.

And one non-primitive data type:
8.object for more complex data structures.


The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.

Usually used as typeof x, but typeof(x) is also possible.
Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".
For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.
